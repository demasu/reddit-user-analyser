You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out.\n\n\u2014\n\nHello again!\n\nIt\u2019s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.\n\nWe started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\n\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \n\nSpeaking of bans, you\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\n\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&amp;hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \n\nSpeaking of which, we\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \n\nIncluding but not limited to\u2026 night mode, user &amp; post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\n\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven\u2019t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).\n\nLast but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.\n\nOther than that, I can\u2019t imagine we have much to talk about, but I\u2019ll hang to around some questions anyway.\n\n\u2014spez",

This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.\n\nFirst, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don\u2019t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \\(You\u2019ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\\) \n\nWe also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \\(Montagna\\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \\(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \\(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\\).\n\nI\u2019d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I\u2019ve mentioned before that we\u2019re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we\u2019re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:\n\nIn my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I\u2019d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: \n\n* 70&amp;#37; \\(662\\) had zero karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(8\\) had negative karma\n* 22&amp;#37; \\(203\\) had 1\\-999 karma\n* 6&amp;#37; \\(58\\) had 1,000\\-9,999 karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(13\\) had a karma score of 10,000\\+\n\nOf the 282 accounts with non\\-zero karma, more than half \\(145\\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation\u2014all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.\n\nAnd as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. \n\nTo give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.\n\nWe still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust &amp; Safety and Anti\\-Evil teams are working. It\u2019s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.\n\nWe know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I\u2019ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.\n\n\u2014Steve \\(spez\\)\n\nupdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!",

We don\u2019t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.\n\nAs for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more.

If you haven\u2019t tried the app in a while, please check it out! \n\nWe added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\\-to\\-profile to chat \\(now in beta for individuals and groups\\), and we\u2019re especially pleased to see features that didn\u2019t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.\n\nNot every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \\(profile pages, anybody?\\), but we\u2019re still working on these features and we\u2019ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you\u2019d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \\(major announcements\\), r/beta \\(long\\-running tests\\), r/modnews \\(moderator features\\), and r/changelog \\(most everything else\\).\n\nI\u2019m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti\\-Evil teams have come. We\u2019ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we\u2019re catching issues before they become issues. I\u2019d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&amp;S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.\n\nThe greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I\u2019ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \\(I\u2019m serious!\\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.\n\nIn 2018, we\u2019ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\\-ish in r/blog. \n\nIt\u2019s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \\(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\\) If you\u2019d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We\u2019ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.\n\nWe\u2019re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\nSteve and the Reddit team\n\nupdate: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.",

It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \\(twice\\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users\u2019 everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \\(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.\n\nIt is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&amp;utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC\u2019s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). \n\nNevertheless, today\u2019s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.\n\nMany of you have asked what comes next. We don\u2019t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC\u2019s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created. Those who thought that they\u2019d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We\u2019ll keep you informed as things develop.\n\nu\\/arabscarab \\(Jessica, our head of policy\\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. \n\n\u2014u\\/spez &amp; u\\/kn0thing\n\nupdate: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).\n\nupdate2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.\n\nupdate3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3\u20132.",

It was inspiring to witness &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/\"&gt;organic takeovers&lt;/a&gt; of the front page (twice), read touching &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/\"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; about how net neutrality matters in users\u2019 everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/\"&gt;discussed on the front page&lt;/a&gt; (with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the &lt;a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/\"&gt;hundreds of thousands of calls&lt;/a&gt; they drove to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&amp;amp;utm_term=.d11780a12cc2\"&gt;public concern&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality\"&gt;objections expressed by his fellow commissioners&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968\"&gt;the FCC\u2019s own CTO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf\"&gt;more than a hundred members of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/\"&gt;dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, today\u2019s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you have asked what comes next. We don\u2019t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC\u2019s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created. Those who thought that they\u2019d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We\u2019ll keep you informed as things develop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;u/arabscarab (Jessica, our head of policy) will also be in the comments to address your questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014u/spez &amp;amp; u/kn0thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality\"&gt;Clyburn and Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3\u20132.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!\n\n*****\n\nHi All,\n\nIf you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what\u2019s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.\n\nOn Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You\u2019ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. \n\nIn just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday\u2019s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.\n\nAs many of you know, the FCC\u2019s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality\u2019s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don\u2019t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.\n\nMost of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \\(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don\u2019t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC\u2019s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel\u2019s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to \u201cmake a ruckus\u201d to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  \n\nA few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we\u2019re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. \n\nWe will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to \u2014 if it comes to it \u2014 the Supreme Court. \n\nSo, please tell us in the comments:\n\n*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* \n\nInclude as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.\n\nThank you.\n\nu/ArabScarab \\(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\\), and I will hang around to answer questions.",

Keep it up, we&amp;#39;re being heard!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you &lt;a href=\"https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae\"&gt;may have noticed a common theme&lt;/a&gt; in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what\u2019s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/\"&gt;announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt;. While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from &lt;a href=\"/r/dataisbeautiful\"&gt;r/dataisbeautiful&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"/r/trashpandas\"&gt;r/trashpandas&lt;/a&gt;. You\u2019ve made &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/\"&gt;high-quality gifs&lt;/a&gt;, flooded &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/\"&gt;the meme market&lt;/a&gt;, explained the issue to people who are &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/\"&gt;out of the loop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/\"&gt;given a history&lt;/a&gt; of why net neutrality rules are essential. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday\u2019s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, the FCC\u2019s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality\u2019s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll\"&gt;data says&lt;/a&gt; that Americans don\u2019t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 (including a protest in DC the day before the vote).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don\u2019t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC\u2019s decision, we encourage you to follow &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html\"&gt;Commissioner Rosenworcel\u2019s suggestion&lt;/a&gt; and continue to \u201cmake a ruckus\u201d to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/\"&gt;asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you&lt;/a&gt;, and thousands of you delivered. Today, we\u2019re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; voices, from Capitol Hill to \u2014 if it comes to it \u2014 the Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, please tell us in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/ArabScarab\"&gt;u/ArabScarab&lt;/a&gt; (Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy), and I will hang around to answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit\u2019s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we\u2019ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we\u2019ve received so far has been super helpful \\(thank you!\\). If you\u2019d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We\u2019ve made many other changes as well, and if you\u2019re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.\n\nIn real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \\(but you never know how these things will go\u2026\\).\n\nLast week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade \u201cinciting violence,\u201d but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don\u2019t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.\n\nAnnnnnnd in other news:\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we\u2019re running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!\n\nThis weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&amp;id=1251). Join our team, play games with the Reddit staff, and help us hit our $250k fundraising goal.\n\nFinally, today we\u2019re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).\n\nSpeaking of the holidays, I\u2019m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I\u2019d love some ideas to keep me busy.\n\n-Steve\n\nupdate: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers!",

Thanks for the questions and feedback. I&amp;#39;ll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).\n\nWe\u2019re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it\u2019s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.\n\nReddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.\n\nOn the product side, we have a lot going on. It\u2019s incredible how much we\u2019re building, and we\u2019re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We\u2019re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can\u2019t wait for you all to see what we\u2019re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.\n\nWe\u2019re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we\u2019re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn\u2019t supported by all browsers, doesn\u2019t work on mobile, and is implemented by few\u2014if any\u2014advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don\u2019t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.\n\nOur Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we\u2019re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).\n\nWhile there is plenty more to report, I\u2019ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I\u2019ll be here a couple hours.\n\n\u2013Steve\n\nu: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.",

This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.\n\nTo give you a sense of our approach, we\u2019re starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know you\u2019d like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which we\u2019re racing to as quickly as possible.\n\nThe widget system I mentioned in the last post isn\u2019t directly related.

A widget system will elevate these features to first-class status on Reddit, with the aim of making them both more powerful and reuseable. Yes, we\u2019re evaluating how we would accept user-created widgets.  We intend for widgets to be able to be updated via the API, so you\u2019ll still be able to create dynamically updating content in your subreddit sidebar.\n\nThis change, and the redesign in general, is going to happen slowly.  We will will not be abruptly cutting everyone over to the new site at once.  We know it won\u2019t be perfect at first (unlike the current site), and plan to include plenty of time to solicit feedback and make iterations.  Sharing our plans for subreddit customization this far advance with you is part of this process.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a small alpha group and create a subreddit to solicit feedback.

Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.

For a long time, we\u2019ve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we\u2019ll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:\n\n* It\u2019s web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We\u2019d love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.\n* CSS is a pain in the ass: it\u2019s difficult to learn; it\u2019s error-prone; and it\u2019s time consuming.\n* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).\n* CSS causes us to move slow. We\u2019d like to make changes more quickly. You\u2019ve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).\n\nWe\u2019re designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.\n\nWe know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we\u2019ll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.\n\nWe will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We\u2019d like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.\n\nHow are we going to get there? We\u2019ll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you\u2019ll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn\u2019t going to be easy for everyone, so we\u2019ll assist communities that want help (i.e. we\u2019ll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.\n\n##**Mod Tools**\n\nMod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).\n\nWe\u2019re in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we\u2019ll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.\n\nThe existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don\u2019t have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.\n\nWhile we have your attention\u2026 we\u2019re also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We\u2019ve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we\u2019ll keep at it regardless.\n\n##**Moving Forward**\n\nWe know moderation can feel janitorial\u2013thankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.\n\nBig changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we\u2019ll be grappling with together\u2013changes to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We\u2019ll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nupdate: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.",

It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\n\nOur goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit\u2019s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.\n\nGenerally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.\n\nAnother way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.\n\nWe participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook\u2019s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.\n\nAgain, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (\u201cKnight\u201d) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court\u2019s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230\u2019s immunity. \n\nThank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.\n\nI\u2019ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can\u2019t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.\n\nSteve (spez)\n",

Amici &lt;a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/\"&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court\u2019s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230\u2019s immunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can\u2019t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve (spez)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.\n\nLast year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago\u2014especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven\u2019t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.\n\nAdditionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.\n\nWe want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.\n\nAs always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.\n\nWe have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.\n\nOne project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!\n\nHere's to a happy, productive, drama-free (ha), 2017!\n\nSteve and the Reddit team\n\nupdate: I'm off for now. Will check back in a couple hours. Thanks!\n",

We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I\u2019m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.\n",

Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:\n\nHopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x\u2026) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.\n\nSpeaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.\n\nPrepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics\u2019. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.\n\nWe have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.\n\nWe did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, \"Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied.\" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.\n\nLastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.\n\nI will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.\n\nSteve\n\nu: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\n\nWe\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.\n\nAs it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we\u2019ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\n\nYesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust &amp; Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%.

The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.\n\nThe changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.\n\nMany people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. \n\nInterestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\u2019s Reddit for you. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nAs always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit\u2014let\u2019s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let\u2019s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.\n\nSteve\n\nu: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours.",

The &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people will ask if this is related to &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt;. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; over the years\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; was already getting downvoted out of &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, &lt;a href=\"/r/EnoughTrumpSpam\"&gt;r/EnoughTrumpSpam&lt;/a&gt; was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\u2019s Reddit for you. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit\u2014let\u2019s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let\u2019s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;u: I&amp;#39;m off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I&amp;#39;ll check back in a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\n\nWhether you agree with r/news\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\n\nWe are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis.
